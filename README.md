# CYBR8470-Final-Project
Food Recipe Web Application


**APPLICATION SUMMARY**
This app is meant to serve as an individual or family based digital recipe storage and reference source.  The idea is to allow someone to manually enter their own creations, old family recipes, or even recipes they like that they found online or from any source, into a local network hosted application.  With recipes stored, the main functionality and service provided by the app, is allowing a user to search for and find a recipe using various critera including:  protein type (beef, chicken, pork, vegetable, seafood, etc.); meal type (soup, salad, sandwich, etc.); and various others.  The benefits allow a user to search for a recipe using ingredients found on sale in a sales flyer, or just find something that just "sounds good right now".

This app additionally uses a popular food/ingredient nutrition and information api Edamam:  https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-docs.  This allows users to find general information about the ingredients in their recipes, view nutritional information about the ingredients in their recipes, or even find recipes base on specific nutritional restrictions or requirements.
