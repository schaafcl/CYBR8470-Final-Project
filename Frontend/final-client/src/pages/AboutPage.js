      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>This application was developed by Chris Schaaf, for the purposes of CYBR8470 Secure Web App Development's final project</p>
      
      <p>This application works as a recipe book to store recipes and allow users to search for recipes by a variety of criteria.  It was meant to address a certain cabinet problem that I imgaine others also experience.  I
        refer to that cabinet that holds stacked cookbooks, overstuffed manilla folders, and piles of loose pages stuffed in a cabinet holding your own as well as your extended family's extensive culinary history.  A user can
        consolidate their many recipes in a locally hosted database, add to them over time, and browse through them based on what's on sale for a given week or what "just sounds good right now".
